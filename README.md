# CC-Websocket
This is the GitHub repository for the CC-Websocket LUA client that works in conjunction to the [VSCode extension](https://github.com/WasteofSpaceYT/CC-Websocket-Reload) to let you update the files in your ComputerCraft computer from VSCode.

Put this client on your ComputerCraft computer by pasting this command into the computer:
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WasteofSpaceYT/CC-Websocket/main/cc-websocket.lua cc-websocket.lua
```

Then run the client by typing `cc-websocket` into the computer.

* Use the `-p` or `-port` flag to specify the websocket port. The default is 3000. Ex. `cc-websocket -p 3000`

* Make sure the VSCode extension is installed and running.
