# CC-Websocket
This is the GitHub repository for the CC-Websocket LUA client that works in conjunction to the [VSCode extension](https://github.com/WasteofSpaceYT/CC-Websocket-Reload) to let you update the files in your ComputerCraft computer from VSCode.

Put this client on your ComputerCraft computer by pasting this command into the computer:
```
wget https://github.com/WasteofSpaceYT/CC-Websocket/blob/ff24b3bb6fdb7831487973fb88404725d1f38313/cc-websocket.lua cc-websocket.lua
```

Then run the client by typing `cc-websocket` into the computer.

* Make sure the VSCode extension is installed and running.
